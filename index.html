                    use some of the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
                    Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).</p>
                <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish
                    content, make a purchase, or fill any forms on the Services. When required, this information may
                    include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)</li>

                <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Services. However, we may also
                    collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as social media platforms and our
                    joint partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may include demographic
                    information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as
                    city and state, and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of social media
                    websites, page view information and search results and links.</p>
                <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take
                    advantage of some of the features on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is
                    mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>

                <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are
                    under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. If you have
                    reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through
                    the Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our
                    Services.</p>
                <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help
                    enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the
                    Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the
                    care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to
                    never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
                <h2 id="use-and-processing-of-collected-information">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
                <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have
                    entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and
                    we would be the data processor.</p>
                <p> Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act
                    in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is
                    necessary to ensure your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a data controller
                    because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
                <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through
                    the Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information,
                    and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such

                <p>In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect
                    and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may
                    not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we
                    collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>

                <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where you are
                    located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
                    more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal
                    Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act; (ii) provision of information is
                    necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
                    thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
                    subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                    exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                    legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
                <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                    processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any
                    case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
                    particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement,
                    or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
                <h2 id="payment-processing">Payment processing</h2>
                <p>In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your credit card details or other
                    payment account information, which will be used solely for processing payments. We use third-party
                    payment processors (“Payment Processors”) to assist us in processing your payment information
                    securely.</p>
                <p>Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards
                    Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
                    Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is
                    encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance with strict
                    vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. We
                    will share payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes of
                    processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and queries related
                    to such payments and refunds.</p>
                <p> Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which allows
                    them to process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank
                    account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process through their systems, including
                    data collection and data processing. The Payment Processors’ use of your Personal Information is
                    governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as
                    protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.</p>
                <h2 id="managing-information">Managing information</h2>
                <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you
                    can delete may change as the Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may
                    maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to
                    comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.
                </p>
                <h2 id="disclosure-of-information">Disclosure of information</h2>
                <p> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any
                    Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies,
                    and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the operation of
                    the Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to
                    abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally
                    identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated
                    third parties.</p>
                <p>Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to
                    perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the
                    information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize
                    them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.
                </p>
                <p>We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by
                    law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith
                    that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
                    investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
                <h2 id="retention-of-information">Retention of information</h2>
                <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                    obligations, as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve
                    disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
                <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you
                    update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention
                    period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
                    erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the
                    expiration of the retention period.</p>
                <h2 id="california-privacy-rights">California privacy rights</h2>
                <p>Consumers residing in California are afforded certain additional rights with respect to their
                    Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). If you are a California
                    resident, this section applies to you.</p>
                <p>In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal
                    Information as defined in the statute to obtain Services for personal, family, or household use are
                    entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the categories and
                    specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected and disclosed.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, California residents have the right to request deletion of their Personal Information or
                    opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information which may include selling, disclosing, or
                    transferring Personal Information to another business or a third party for monetary or other
                    valuable consideration. To do so, simply contact us. We will not discriminate against you if you
                    exercise your rights under the CCPA.</p>
                <h2 id="how-to-exercise-your-rights">How to exercise your rights</h2>
                <p>Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to us through the contact details provided in
                    this document. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such
                    requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the
                    person you are claiming to be or that you are the authorized representative of such person. If we
                    receive your request from an authorized representative, we may request evidence that you have
                    provided such an authorized representative with power of attorney or that the authorized
                    representative otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests on your behalf.</p>
                <p>You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and respond to it.
                    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first verify
                    your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information relates
                    to you.</p>
                <h2 id="data-analytics">Data analytics</h2>
                <p>Our Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar
                    information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information. The
                    information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such as how often Users
                    visit our Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained
                    from these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our Services.</p>
                <h2 id="do-not-track-signals">Do Not Track signals</h2>
                <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                    want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting
                    information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting
                    personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as
                    they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is
                    not yet uniform. As a result, the Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not
                    Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this
                    Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.</p>
                <h2 id="advertisements">Advertisements</h2>
                <p>We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information
                    about our customers that we or our advertisers collect through your use of the Services. We do not
                    share personally identifiable information about individual customers with advertisers. In some
                    instances, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored
                    advertisements to the intended audience.</p>
                <h2 id="email-marketing">Email marketing</h2>
                <p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed
                    to keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third
                    parties except as allowed in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of
                    utilizing a third-party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent via
                    e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                <p>In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is
                    from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving
                    our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these
                    emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.
                </p>
                <h2 id="links-to-other-resources">Links to other resources</h2>
                <p>The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware
                    that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
                    encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and
                    every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
                <h2 id="information-security">Information security</h2>
                <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
                    from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
                    physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
                    disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over
                    the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.</p>
                <p>Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are
                    security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security,
                    integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Services
                    cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in
                    transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
                <p>As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you use to
                    communicate with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please take appropriate
                    measures to protect this information.</p>
                <h2 id="data-breach">Data breach</h2>
                <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been compromised or Users’
                    Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
                    including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
                    appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
                    notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we
                    will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable
                    risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When
                    we do, we will send you an email.</p>
                <h2 id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Services at any time at our
                    discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page, send you an
                    email to notify you. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as
                    through the contact information you have provided.</p>
                <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised
                    Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of
                    the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those
                    changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner
                    materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.</p>
